# Traffic Cone Volume Calculator

Caleb asked me a question "How many traffic cones do you think you could fit in your house?".... I just wanna know.

I've created, in Python 3, a calculator to answer this question for us and prove his friend wrong.

>**Spoiler Alert:** We were all horribly wrong!

## Description

Basically just install python and you can run it from there. It's a simple calculator to get the job done and spit some results.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

It's simple, just run it with a python interpreter, it's not intended to be a big project
